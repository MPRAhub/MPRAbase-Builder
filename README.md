# MPRAbase-Builder

The purpose of the MPRAbase-Builder repository is for semi-automating how to contribute a NextGenerationSequencing **(NGS) object** to MPRAbase. Here we provide an automated MPRAsnakeflow primary quality control report in Rmarkdown format and data wrangling your NGS object for contributing to MPRAbase.
