# MPRAbase-Builder

The MPRAbase-Builder repository serves the purpose of semi-automating the process of contributing a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) object to MPRAbase. It provides an automated MPRAsnakeflow primary quality control report in Rmarkdown format, as well as the **library(MPRAbase)** data wrangling capabilities for preparing your NGS object for submission to MPRAbase.
